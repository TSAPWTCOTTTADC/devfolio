          'Allotted one to two months to design a video game to present during the yearly celebration for the accomplishments of each of the schoolâ€™s different magnet programs. Gained experience with collaborative programming and applied programming. Worked with a separate person on the project, each completing different portions of the game, in order to combine them for the finished product. An example was that one person programmed level generation while the other programmed how the character would move. NOTE: link leads to nothing',
